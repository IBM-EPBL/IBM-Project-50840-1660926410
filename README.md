The healthcare industry is no exception. Healthcare big data promises several benefits which includes everything from better patient treatment to 
better health outcomes and improved diagnostics. Natural language processing or NLP in healthcare has changed the way doctors and medical professionals

patient voice in their operations which allows them to deliver improved patient experiences.

resource allocation and better functioning. The length of stay is divided into 11 different classes ranging from 0-10 days to more than 100 days.
